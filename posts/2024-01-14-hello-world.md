# Hello World

This is the first post of my new blogging system. Let's test some Markdown features:

* a list with one
* two
* three items

Let's make a **bold** statement. It's not *that* bold. Let's _underline_ that. And that is `fixed`. Here is a [link to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org).

```javascript
{
    "post": "w00t"
}
```

And some Java:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> l = new ArrayList<>();
        l.add("foo");
        l.add("bar");
        for (var s : l) {
            System.err.println(s);
        }
    }
}
```
