# Hello World

> One small blog for me, but a giant blog for mankind.

&mdash;Abraham Lincoln

This is the first post of my new blogging system. Let's test some Markdown features:

* a list with one
* two
* three items

Let's make a **bold** statement. It's not *that* bold. Let's _underline_ that. And that is `fixed`. Here is a [link to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org). And this is a link to my [other post](posts/2023-12-24-merry-christmas.md).

Here is some pointless Java code:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.err.println("hello, world!")
    }
}
```
